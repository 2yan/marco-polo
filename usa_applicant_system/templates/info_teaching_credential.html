{% block what %}
<p><i><u>Before you begin:</u> We assume that you have no formal background in education. If you have a college degree in education, you may be overqualified for this program.</i></p>

<p>To teach English in China, you need to complete a 120-hour TEFL/TESOL course. TEFL stands for Teaching English as a Foreign Language, and focuses more on teaching non-native speakers in non-immersive environments (e.g. teaching English to Chinese speakers in China). TESOL stands for Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages, and includes teaching non-native speakers in immersive environments (e.g. teaching English to Chinese speakers in the United States). While there is overlap between the two, we recommend TEFL because it is more applicable to your future position.</p>

<p>Once you have completed the course, you need to have your certificate authenticated by the Chinese embassy. We will guide you through the authentication process, but you must complete the course yourself.</p>
{% endblock %}

{% block why %}
<p>As a native speaker, you have impeccable pronunciation and an inherent feel for English syntax and grammar. (That's why Chinese parents want you to teach their kid.) You know that "the Irish, big, old, pale man" <i>sounds</i> wrong, but you probably don't know <i>why</i> it has to be the "big, old, pale, Irish man." This course will help you with that. It will also teach you how to make lesson plans, deal with problem students, and make grammar lessons fun and engaging.</p>

<p>China has three different tiers for work visas -- A, B, and C. This tier system was implemented in 2017, and its goal is to streamline the work visa process and ensure a high level of foreign talent. If you are curious about the different tiers, you can learn more <a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-work-permits-are-you-a-b-c-tier-talent/">here</a>.</p>

<p>You need to have a Tier B work visa to be an English teacher. One requirement for a Tier B visa is to "hold an internationally recognized ceritification that is urgently needed in the Chinese labor market", which in this case is a TEFL certificate. The document first needs to be notarized so that the Chinese embassy knows your degree is legitimate and has not been forged. It is then authenticated by the Chinese embassy so that government authorities in China know that your certificate is legitimate.</p>

<p>Normally, the process would take 3-5 steps, depending on which state you are from and where the issuing institution is physically located. However, by partnering with CVSC, we are able to streamline the process and take advantage of favorable conditions in Texas. To cut down on shipping costs, we are going to have you ship your college diploma and your TEFL/TOEFL certificate together.</p>
